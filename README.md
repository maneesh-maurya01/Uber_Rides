# Uber_Rides

## ðŸš– Uber Rides SQL Case Study
## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project analyzes an Uber rides dataset using PostgreSQL to extract business insights.
It demonstrates SQL skills across window functions, views, indexing, null checks, and business queries, followed by dashboard integration in Power BI.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

* Perform data cleaning and transformation in SQL.
* Write 50+ SQL business queries (basic to advanced).
* Build analytical views in PostgreSQL for optimized BI reporting.
* Apply Window Functions (LAG, LEAD, RANK, NTILE, etc.).
* Create Views for BI-ready datasets.
* Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for decision-making
---

## ðŸ“Š Case Study Scenario

* Uberâ€™s management wants a data-driven strategy to improve:

* Customer retention (loyalty programs, churn detection)

* Driver performance (ratings, cancellations, revenue contribution)

* Operational efficiency (peak demand hours, incomplete rides reasons)

* Revenue forecasting (daily/monthly trends, vehicle type analysis)

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies
* SQL (PostgreSQL or MySQL)
* pgAdmin / MySQL Workbench (querying)
* Excel / Power BI (optional for visualizations)
* Git & GitHub (version control)

## ðŸ§® SQL Analysis

 - **Basic Queries**  
  Simple queries to get high-level insights such as total bookings, average booking value, or average ride distance.

- **Intermediate Queries**  
  Queries that explore patterns and trends, like revenue over time, ride distance vs. booking value, or cancellation percentages by customer vs. driver.

- **Advanced Queries**  
  Complex analyses such as ranking top routes, calculating moving averages for revenue, or identifying seasonal demand trends.

- **Window Functions**  
  Analytical functions like RANK, DENSE_RANK, LAG, LEAD, and NTILE to rank customers, compare bookings, and segment spend behavior.

- **Views**  
  Predefined saved queries (views) for quick access, such as daily revenue summaries, top customer lists, or route performance analysis.
